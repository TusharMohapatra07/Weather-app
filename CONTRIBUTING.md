## Setup Instructions :

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**

    If this project is hosted on a version control system like Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TusharMohapatra07/Weather-app.git
    cd Weather-app
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    This project uses Node.js and npm. Install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command installs all packages listed in `package.json` into the `node_modules` directory.

3.  **Start the Development Server:**

    This project is configured with a development server that automatically reloads the browser when you make changes. To start it, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    **Important:** Once you run `npm dev`, the server will usually run in your terminal. You'll need to keep this terminal window open while you're developing. The server will provide you with a local URL (usually `http://localhost:<port>` or `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`) that you can open in your web browser to view the project.
